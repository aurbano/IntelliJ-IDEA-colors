# IntelliJ-IDEA-colors
My personal color scheme for IntelliJ IDEA, it's a dark theme that uses distinct colors for each language feature, but similar ones for related parts (shades of blue for methods, oranges for language defaults... )

### Java

### JavaScript

I should probably make Java and JavaScript a bit more similar though, although it's also a good thing being able to tell them appart at a glance.
