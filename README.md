# My IntelliJ IDEA Theme
My personal color scheme for IntelliJ IDEA, it's a dark theme that uses distinct colors for each language feature, but similar ones for related parts (shades of blue for methods, oranges for language defaults... )

## Install
1. Download [color settings jar](https://github.com/aurbano/IntelliJ-IDEA-colors/raw/master/aurbano.jar) file.
2. Open IntelliJ, and go to File > Import Settings...
3. Select the downloaded Jar file

Some versions of IntelliJ might not recognize the jar file, or you probably don't trust jar files. In that case do the following:

1. Download the plain text [`aurbano.icls`](https://github.com/aurbano/IntelliJ-IDEA-colors/blob/master/aurbano.icls) file
2. Put it in `%IntelliJSettings%/config/colors`
3. Restart the IDE and you should see the new option in `Settings > Editor > Colors & Fonts`.
